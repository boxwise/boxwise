# Contributing to Boxwise

First off: **thank you**. You will be helping build software that distributes clothes and food to thousands of refugees, homeless and other people in need. It gives comfort and dignity to people in a vulnerable situation. That can't be said for most open source contributions.

If you haven't done so already, [join the #dev channel in our Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/boxwise/shared_invite/enQtMzE4NzExMjkxNTM2LTk0MzY2Mjg0MTY5ZmJjMjI1ODNmODZiNmJlNTAwM2Y4MmJkZDJjZWEyNzk0YTQyZGI0ZTYxMTc2NTgxNjk1ZTM). That is where all the people who build Boxwise are. It's a great place to ask questions.
If you are new, please introduce yourself in the #introductions channel.
A couple of quick things:

- **Saturday is Boxwise Day!** We meet online each Saturday at 10am CET. Check out the [slack #dev channel]((https://join.slack.com/t/boxwise/shared_invite/enQtMzE4NzExMjkxNTM2LTk0MzY2Mjg0MTY5ZmJjMjI1ODNmODZiNmJlNTAwM2Y4MmJkZDJjZWEyNzk0YTQyZGI0ZTYxMTc2NTgxNjk1ZTM)) for more details.
- **Do you need help using Boxwise?** [Join our Slack group and ask in the #support channel.](https://join.slack.com/t/boxwise/shared_invite/enQtMzE4NzExMjkxNTM2LTk0MzY2Mjg0MTY5ZmJjMjI1ODNmODZiNmJlNTAwM2Y4MmJkZDJjZWEyNzk0YTQyZGI0ZTYxMTc2NTgxNjk1ZTM) A GitHub issue is probably not the best place for this.
- **Have you found a bug, or got an idea for a feature?** [File it in our issue tracker.](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/issues/new) Use the search box to make sure nobody has filed it already, please.

For everything else, please read on...

## Guidelines

- **Start small.** Contributing to a new project can be quite daunting. We've put a ["good first issue" label](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/labels/good%20first%20issue) on issues that are easy to start with.
- **Be bold!** If there is something that needs fixing, go for it. We are always looking for help.
- **Make sure your idea has support.** Before spending a lot of time on a feature, it's worth checking that it is wanted first. Ask around in Slack, or create a feature request issue to get feedback.
- **Write tests, if you can.** We are a young project, so we move fast (and break things, unfortunately). But, if you have time, it is worth writing tests for your work. That way we can confirm that the code you are contributing does what you say it does, and we can ensure it doesn't break in the future.
- **Constructive criticism** If you do not like a contribution, feel free to air it. However, before doing so think first about how to improve and propose alternative solutions.

## Making a contribution

First, set up a development environment using the instructions in the readme.
Once you have made your change, submit a pull request with a clear description of what you have done and why. Reference any issues that are relevant. Please write [good commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages), ideally as a series of logical commits by ["squashing" them](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Beginner's-guide-to-rebasing-and-squashing). (Don't worry if you don't know how to squash commits - we can do that when we merge your code.)

If you haven't contributed to open source before, take a look at [this guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). If you haven't used Git or GitHub before, [this is a tutorial](http://makeapullrequest.com/) that will help. Don't be afraid to ask for help, if you need it. (Everyone is a beginner at some point!)

You can contribute in lots of ways that aren't code, too. For example:

- [Join our Slack group and help people in the #support channel.](https://join.slack.com/t/boxwise/shared_invite/enQtMzE4NzExMjkxNTM2LTk0MzY2Mjg0MTY5ZmJjMjI1ODNmODZiNmJlNTAwM2Y4MmJkZDJjZWEyNzk0YTQyZGI0ZTYxMTc2NTgxNjk1ZTM).
- Report bugs and feature suggestions in [our issue tracker](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/issues).
- Spread the word! We are always on the lookout for contributors. Blog, tweet, all those things. We are on [facebook](www.facebook.com/pg/boxwise.co) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/12997513).
- [Donate to our cause if you have some spare money lying around!](https://donate.boxwise.co)
- [Get in touch!](mailto:hans@boxwise.co) If you want to give us your opinion or just generally offer your time to help us, feel always welcome to contact us!

## Project management

We have a weekly online meeting of all active developers each Saturday. It starts usually at 10am CET. The first 60 to 90 min we discuss problems, prioritize / distribute tasks and make decisions. After the team meeting, we start directly with diving into our tasks. We usually keep our conference call open to be available for quick answers. If you need to leave at a certain stage, it is no problem at all. Just try to be at the team meeting.

We use the [github issues](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/issues) and prioritize the tasks roughly with [milestones](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/milestones). If somebody hasn't already claimed a ticket, feel free to pick it up! It's probably worth adding a comment to say that you are working on something, in case somebody else wants to work on it too.
<!--
We use [a GitHub project](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/projects/1) to keep track of what we want to build, and what is being worked on. The "To do" column is roughly priority sorted, so is a good place to find stuff that we consider high priority. -->

## Development principles

These are the principles that have guided our development so far. If you're making a major contribution, it may be worth keeping them in mind.

- **Use boring, well-established technology.** Boxwise needs to keep on working for a long time with minimal work. We don't want to have to rewrite it every year because a technology we are using has gone out of fashion.
- **Minimal maintenance.** We don't have an operations team, nor anyone who can commit to being on-call. The app should run with minimal server-poking.
- **Keep it simple.** 50 lines of straightforward, readable code is better than 10 lines of magic that nobody can understand. ([source](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/project/PRINCIPLES.md))
- **Optimize for contributions.** The code needs to be approachable and easy to understand, particularly for junior developers. Consider whether that clever new technology is worth it if a junior developer will struggle to get their head around it.
- **Move fast and don't break things.** We should ship continuously, but use browser tests to avoid breaking things. These tests should check the basic tasks users need to do to get their jobs done.
