# Contributing to Boxwise

First off: **thank you**. You will be helping build software that distributes clothes and food to thousands of refugees. It gives comfort and dignity to people in a vulnerable situation. That can't be said for most open source contributions.

If you haven't done so already, [join the #dev channel in our Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/boxwise/shared_invite/enQtMzE4NzExMjkxNTM2LTk0MzY2Mjg0MTY5ZmJjMjI1ODNmODZiNmJlNTAwM2Y4MmJkZDJjZWEyNzk0YTQyZGI0ZTYxMTc2NTgxNjk1ZTM). That is where all the people who build Boxwise are. It's a great place to ask questions.

A couple of quick things:

- **Do you need help using Boxwise?** [Join our Slack group and ask in the #support channel.](https://join.slack.com/t/boxwise/shared_invite/enQtMzE4NzExMjkxNTM2LTk0MzY2Mjg0MTY5ZmJjMjI1ODNmODZiNmJlNTAwM2Y4MmJkZDJjZWEyNzk0YTQyZGI0ZTYxMTc2NTgxNjk1ZTM) A GitHub issue is probably not the best place for this.
- **Have you found a bug, or got an idea for a feature?** [File it in our issue tracker.](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/issues/new) Use the search box to make sure nobody has filed it already, please.

For everything else, please read on...

## Guidelines

- **Start small.** Contributing to a new project can be quite daunting. We've put a ["good first issue" label](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/labels/good%20first%20issue) on issues that are easy to start with.
- **Be bold!** If there is something that needs fixing, go for it. We are always looking for help.
- **Make sure your idea has support.** Before spending a lot of time on a feature, it's worth checking that it is wanted first. Ask around in Slack, or create a feature request issue to get feedback.
- **Write tests, if you can.** We are a young project, so we move fast (and break things, unfortunately). But, if you have time, it is worth writing tests for your work. That way we can confirm that the code you are contributing does what you say it does, and we can ensure it doesn't break in the future.

## Making a contribution

First, set up a development environment using [the instructions in the readme](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise#setting-up-development-environment).

Once you have made your change, submit a pull request with a clear description of what you have done and why. Reference any issues that are relevant. Please write [good commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages), ideally as a series of logical commits by ["squashing" them](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Beginner's-guide-to-rebasing-and-squashing). (Don't worry if you don't know how to squash commits - we can do that when we merge your code.)

If you haven't contributed to open source before, take a look at [this guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). If you haven't used Git or GitHub before, [this is a tutorial](http://makeapullrequest.com/) that will help. Don't be afraid to ask for help, if you need it. (Everyone is a beginner at some point!)

You can contribute in lots of ways that aren't code, too. For example:

- [Join our Slack group and help people in the #support channel.](https://join.slack.com/t/boxwise/shared_invite/enQtMzE4NzExMjkxNTM2LTk0MzY2Mjg0MTY5ZmJjMjI1ODNmODZiNmJlNTAwM2Y4MmJkZDJjZWEyNzk0YTQyZGI0ZTYxMTc2NTgxNjk1ZTM).
- Spread the word! We are always on the lookout for contributors. Blog, tweet, all those things.
- Report bugs and feature suggestions in [our issue tracker](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/issues).

## Project management

We use [a GitHub project](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise/projects/1) to keep track of what we want to build, and what is being worked on. The "To do" column is roughly priority sorted, so is a good place to find stuff that we consider high priority.

If somebody hasn't already claimed a ticket, feel free to pick it up! It's probably worth adding a comment to say that you are working on something, in case somebody else wants to work on it too.
